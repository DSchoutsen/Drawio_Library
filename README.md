# Background

I used to work with Visio and the stencils from https://github.com/David-Summers/Azure-Design

I recently made aware of Draw.io, but missed the Azure icons that where:

- Up-to-date with the latest services
- consistent in size and naming
- got connections points
- and beautiful

So I forked the repository of David, got rid of the Archives and Visio Stencils and created a PowerShell script that generates the Draw.io library .xml based on the .svg files.
